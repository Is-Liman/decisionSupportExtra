## Overview

The decisionSupportExtra package provides additional functions for the
decisionSupport package, for facilitating expert
elicitation of complex systems modelling under uncertainity. For
example, the package provides facilities for formatting the output
generated by decisionSupport's 
[make\_CPT](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/decisionSupport/versions/1.103.8/topics/make_CPT)
as input for
[cptable](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/gRain/versions/1.3-0/topics/cptable).
outputs of these can also be visualized (as plots) for further analyses and
use.

decisionSupportExtra is at the early development stage, hence your

version using:
